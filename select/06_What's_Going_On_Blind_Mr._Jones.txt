I've got my face to the floor,
Who could ask for more?
My head's gone haywire,
My body's on fire.
See that girl over there,
She's so happy, she don't care.
This music makes me feel good,
And I know it should.

It's in my head and it's in my eyes.
I could die if it felt alright.
Everything's good and nothing's wrong.
Tell the world what's going on,
What's going on.

Don't tell them that you're here,
As they'll try to stop you.
You're with your friends now,
We'll get through somehow.
