What's Going On

Tell Me

People Dying
People Crying
Lord help us

Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying

Oh, brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying

That's Right

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Oh my father, father
We don't need to escalate

You see war is not the answer

For only love can conquer hate

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Barricades, can't block our way

Don't punish me with brutality

Talk to me
So you can see

Oh what's going on
What's going on
Yeah what's going on
Ahh what's going on

What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on

Ah tell me
What's going on in the world today
I'd rather be dead
Than turn my head away
We gotta first world vision to complete, to lift our
Hands in the air and cry for a switch

Father, father

Father help us, come on
We fall
