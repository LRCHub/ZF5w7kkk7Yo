Does anybody realize whats goin on
Take a look around and you will see that were destroying ourselves
Does everybody out there have a chip on their shoulders?
Or is it that weve got nothing, nothing better to do?
Beatings of five to one wasnt enough
Now were using everything from chains
To knives and guns
How much more of this do we have to take
Before we realize its such a senseless waste

Does anybody out there hear the cries?
Of mothers who have lost their children
To your foolish games
When are you gonna realize
That its all just, just a senseless waste?

You think that its just a game
Well, ive got one thing to explain
Someday your luck will fail
Then youll wind up dead or jailed
